There is an ideal random number generator, which given a positive integer M can generate any real number between 0 to M with equal probability.
Suppose we generate 2 numbers x and y via the generator by giving it 2 positive intergers A and B, what's the probability that x + y is less than C? where C is a positive integer.
 
Input Format
The first line of the input is an integer N, the number of test cases.
N lines follow. Each line contains 3 positive integers A, B and C.
All the integers are no larger than 10000.
 
Output Format
For each output, output a fraction that indicates the probability. The greatest common divisor of each pair of numerator and denominator should be 1.
